0.000322814722129	138	Campus Network.mobile_node_Xcom	Config.	Wireless LAN	Distance Limit Exceeded	WARNING: <NL>  The propagation delay between the two WLAN nodes of same BSS <NL>   <NL>  Campus Network.mobile_node_Xcom and <NL>  Campus Network.mobile_node_1 <NL>   <NL>  is greater than the maximum propagation delay allowed by the <NL>  IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard, which is 1 microsecond. Due  <NL>  to violation of this rule, a degradation of WLAN <NL>  performance is possible within the BSS of these nodes. <NL>   <NL>  This message will not be repeated even if the same condition <NL>  is detected between two other WLAN nodes in the network. <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTION: <NL>  Bring these nodes closer to each so that the distance <NL>  between them is less than 300 meters if you want the <NL>  configuration of these nodes to comply with the rules of the <NL>  802.11 standard fully. <NL>  
600	3050119	Campus Network.mobile_node_Xcom	Results	IP	Results	SUGGESTION(s): <NL> You might be able to improve the performance of this simulation <NL> by configuring the 'IP Source Dest Pairs' environment attribute <NL> as described below. Note that the value of this attribute will <NL> not affect the results of the simulation. <NL>   <NL> The IP forwarding mechanism can be tuned to maintain peak <NL> performance while simulating large IP networks. The trade off is <NL> that higher values of this attribute will require more memory. <NL> The optimal value can be calculated as the maximum number of <NL> unique IP source destination pairs that will pass through any <NL> IP routing node in the network. <NL>   <NL> The first value given below is the value used for this <NL> simulation. It was either configured explicitly through the <NL> environment attribute or estimated before the simulation based <NL> on various parameters such as the number of nodes and demands. <NL> The recommended value given is a more accurate estimate computed <NL> after the simulation. <NL>   <NL> Estimated/Configured value: 1 <NL> Recommended value: 4 <NL>   <NL> ACTION(s): <NL> 1. If the estimated value and optimal values are close or if <NL>    performace is not a critical issue for this simulation, <NL>    this message may be ignored. <NL> 2. If the above values are significantly different from each <NL>    other and simulation performance is important, set the value <NL>    of the environment attribute `IP Source Dest Pairs' through an <NL>    environment (.ef) file. Please refer the product documentation <NL>    for more information on environment files and how to use them. <NL> 3. This attribute does not have to be set to the optimal value <NL>    suggested above. Setting this attribute to a higher value might <NL>    increase simulation performance with the trade off that memory <NL>    usage will also increase. Similarly, a lower value may be used <NL>    to decrease memory usage by sacrificing performance. <NL> 4. To disable the printing of this log message set the boolean <NL>    environment attribute 'IP Source Dest Pairs Log' to 'disabled' <NL>
